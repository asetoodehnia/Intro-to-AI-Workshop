# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Workshop

This repository has been put together to give a brief overview into some of the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence.  Feel free to clone the repo and read through the slides to get an overview of the topics then try to apply your knowledge by working through the iPython notebooks!  If you don't already have jupyter installed on your computer, you can also click on the link below which will create a binder so that you can run all the notebooks straight through your very own browser.  Happy learning :)
